<h1>The CTA’s Core Values and Commitment to Excellence</h1>
<p>Physics and Astronomy are for everyone.</p>
<p>The LANL Center for Theoretical Astrophysics is committed to building
and maintaining a supportive experience for all who participate. The CTA
exists as a collection of people with many distinct life experiences and
perspectives. The inclusion and participation of the breadth of human
experience within our community is vitally important to the health and
well-being of the scientific enterprise. Empirical evidence shows that a
wide range of perspectives leads to better solutions to problems, better
decision-making, and better outcomes. Moreover, discrimination and
exclusion are damaging, both to those affected and to the scientific
community, squandering precious talent.</p>
<p>Everyone is welcome in our community. This includes but is not
limited to people of all personal expressions, sexual and romantic
orientations, veteran statuses, ethnic backgrounds, religions, and
political affiliations.</p>
<p>We are aware of the many different backgrounds and experiences people
in our organization have. We believe it is necessary to respect the
value that these experiences bring to one’s scientific work. Being true
to these ideals requires regular and renewed action. Safe, inclusive,
and harassment-free environments don’t just happen. They are created by
the respectful day-to-day interactions we all have with each other.</p>
<p>Disruptive or harassing behavior of any kind is unacceptable.
Harassment includes but is not limited to inappropriate or intimidating
behavior and language, unwanted touching or attention, offensive images,
photography without permission, and stalking. Avoid making inappropriate
actions or statements based on characteristics such as age, race,
ethnicity, sexual orientation, marital status, nationality, political
affiliation, ability status, or educational background. We share a
collaborative spirit. Although we often must, for example, compete for
funding, we are fundamentally collaborators. We feel when we help each
other succeed, we all succeed. Our goal is to build and sustain a
welcoming community where everyone feels they belong and where our
science can thrive and grow.</p>
<p>We engage in continuous learning. We are always open to the idea that
we may be wrong. We allow space for respectful disagreement and
discussion. We acknowledge our errors when they are brought to our
attention. And when we err, we take it as an opportunity to learn. We
actively work to make sure that all of our colleagues feel respected and
included, and we speak up if we feel this is not happening. We discuss
the message, not the messenger. We try to focus discussion and
commentary on what is being spoken, not who is speaking.</p>
<p>We encourage our members to challenge authorities, ask difficult
questions, and engage instimulating discussions. Science thrives on
contradictions. We allow everyone the space to have their voice
heard.</p>
<p>Our values are meant to serve our community. As such, this text is a
living document. It is intended as a conversation. We encourage anyone
with concerns to bring them forward for discussion.</p>
